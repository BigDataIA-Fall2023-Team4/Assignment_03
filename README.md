# Problem Statement:

This project's primary challenge is to automate the creation of embeddings and populate a vector database using Airflow pipelines. It involves data acquisition, processing, and insertion into Pinecone's vector database. Additionally, the development of a client-facing application using FastAPI and Streamlit is crucial, featuring user registration, secure login, a Question Answering interface, and the ability to select and search preprocessed forms. The goal is to deploy all microservices to a public cloud platform for public accessibility, offering a comprehensive and user-friendly solution. We also tested multiple scenarios of users experimenting Q/A with the OpenAI bot on Streamlit.
